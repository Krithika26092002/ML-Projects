Stock market analysis involves using algorithms and statistical models to analyze and predict the behavior of stock prices and overall market trends. 
Machine learning techniques can be applied to historical stock market data to identify patterns, make predictions, and assist in investment decision-making.
Linear Regression: Linear regression is a basic algorithm used to model the relationship between independent variables (such as historical stock prices or economic indicators) and a dependent variable (e.g., future stock price). It fits a linear equation to the data and can be used for simple price prediction tasks.

Support Vector Machines (SVM): SVM is a supervised learning algorithm that can be used for classification or regression tasks. It finds a hyperplane that best separates the data points or predicts the values based on the support vectors. SVMs can handle complex data relationships and are useful for predicting stock price movements.
