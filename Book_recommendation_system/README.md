This project is not yet completly complete. The main machine learning part of the program is running well but the deployment of the machine learning part on a website now there is some issue to be solved in that.
if np.any(pt.index==user_input): index = np.where(pt.index==user_input)[0] index = index[0] The issue was in this part of the code the pt.index are the values of the books names and user_input is the book the user wants to search. The value has to match at some point but the value never does. A few others got this error as well but no one completly solved it. (Hope you solve it in the future) The link to the video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YoD0fg3_EM&t=2206s
